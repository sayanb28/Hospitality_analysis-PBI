## Overview:
The dashboards provide a detailed analysis of hotel performance, focusing on critical metrics such as bookings, revenue, occupancy, and cancellations. They are designed to present trends, compare performance across properties and cities, and highlight areas that require attention.

Incorporating features like the Previous Month (PM) filter, the dashboards enable seamless comparisons with past performance, facilitating the identification of key changes and patterns. By offering insights into booking platforms, room categories, and city-wise performance, these dashboards serve as a valuable tool for enhancing operational efficiency and driving data-driven decisions in the hospitality industry.
